      <p> <span>Voil√†!</span> In view, a humble <span>vaudevillian</span> <span>veteran</span>, cast <span>vicariously</span> as both <span>victim</span> and <span>villain</span> by the <span>vicissitudes</span> of Fate. This <span>visage</span>, no mere <span>veneer</span> of <span>vanity</span>, is a <span>vestige</span> of the <span>vox</span> populi, now <span>vacant</span>, <span>vanished</span>. However, this <span>valorous</span> <span>visitation</span> of a by-gone <span>vexation</span>, stands <span>vivified</span> and has <span>vowed</span> to <span>vanquish</span> these <span>venal</span> and <span>virulent vermin vanguarding vice</span> and <span>vouchsafing</span> the <span>violently vicious</span> and <span>voracious violation</span> of <span>volition</span>.The only <span>verdict</span> is <span>vengeance</span>; a <span>vendetta</span>, held as a <span>votive</span>, not in <span>vain</span>, for the <span>value</span> and <span>veracity</span> of such shall one day <span>vindicate</span> the <span>vigilant</span> and the <span>virtuous</span>. <span>Verily</span>, this <span>vichyssoise</span> of <span>verbiage</span><span>veers</span> most <span>verbose</span>, so let me simply add that it's my <span>very</span> good honor to meet you and you may call me <span>V</span>. </p>
